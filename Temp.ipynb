    "Hi,\n",

    "I found the setup of pystan a little tricky. It needs a compiler. If you haven't set it up yet, I think you can find this link useful.\n",

    "In this tutorial, the difficulty is finding distutils.cfg. If your setting is default, I think you will find it in \\anaconda3\\Lib\\distutils.\n",

    "The following is our model and data that I have initially sorted out based on the professor's documents. According to the professor's prompt, I think we need the following four tasksï¼š\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Compare the ability of your model to predict the winner of new (unseen) games to simple approaches, such as fraction of games won, number of games played, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Try evaluating how many games are required to accurately predict the players' skill levels / win probability by decreasing the amount of training data available and observing the performance. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. Try evaluating how quickly you can determine a new players' skill by either random game choices or carefully chosen games (matched based on estimated skill level).  You can leave a player out of the inference process entirely, then slowly add their games in and see how quickly you are able to learn their relative position.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4. Experiment with learning a more complex model, for example taking into account game features (player's selected character) or additional latent scores (such as offensive and defensive skill) along with a correspondingly more elaborate probability of win function.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    " I believe we need find a way to evaluate our model. May be the prediction of loss?"
